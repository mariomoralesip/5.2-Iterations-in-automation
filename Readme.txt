What are automation iterations?

Automation iterations are repetitive sets of steps that help users automate entire tasks. Many of the daily tasks faced by any employee include at least one iteration.

Let's go back to the example of credit applications. In the previous lesson, the robot had to decide whether the credit application was admissible or not. At the moment, there are more than 300 credit applications pending. 

How can we process them all without adding so many If activities? 

With a For Each activity. This way, the automation will go through each credit application in the given space.

Iterations in action

Let's now see exactly how iterations work in a real business scenario.

To do this, we'll go back to the previous task: making sure that all transactions in a spreadsheet are processed with the help of the Double UI dummy bank teller application. In the previous lesson, you discovered how to process the first transaction, avoiding double work. In this one, you will see how you can make the automation repeat those steps for each transaction documented in the spreadsheet. You will build on the workflow you have already created for the previous lesson. And you will make use of a For Each activity.

In the development of the automation you will use the following input files, websites and applications:

The spreadsheet "Transactions - May2022" - all transactions are documented here.
The Double UI application - this is the transaction processing tool.
